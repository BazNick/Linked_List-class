# Linked_List-class
Single Linked List implementation in Python 3

In this implementation I have following methods:
- Checking size of a Linked List;
- Checking if List is empty;
- Creating/Adding elements in the List;
- Displaying full List;
- Searching elements;
- Adding to the beginning of a List;
- Adding in random position;
- Removing/Deleting the element;
